# qqplot
 A Q-Q Plot assesses quantile similarity between a dataset and a theoretical distribution (Uniform or Normal for this version). It plots observed quantiles against expected quantiles from the distribution. This implementation functions as a QGIS plugin for geospatial data analysis.

 In the Synthetic Data Folder directory, you can find synthetic data to test the plugin.

#To enable the clustering function, you need to install scikit-learn. Follow these steps:#
