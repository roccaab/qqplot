# qqplot
 A Q-Q Plot assesses quantile similarity between a dataset and a theoretical distribution. It plots observed quantiles against expected quantiles from the distribution. This implementation functions as a QGIS plugin for geospatial data analysis.

 In the Synthetic Data Folder directory, you can find synthetic data to test the plugin.
